# CrypToad
A cryptocurrency trading algorithm utilizing Shrimpy's universal API built to linearize randomness in the market.

## Rationale
Instead of building a trading algorithm to _predict_ the market, I wanted to try to build an algorithm to react to the market. This way, very little data is needed to determine actions.

## Steps to Start
1) `https://github.com/tbaumer22/cryptoad.git`
2) `cd cryptoad`
3) `npm install`
4) Configure
5) `npm start`

### Configuration
The configuration of this bot uses an environment file. After cloning, add a `.env` file to the repository root and fill in the data shown in `.env.example`

## Contributing
Any edits to improve the speed, efficiency, or add new features are happily welcomed. Please make a pull-request into Master if you'd like to do so.

## Why Toad?
The graph of this algorithm is modeled to resemble the path of a hopping frog. _Frog_ does not blend well with _crypto_, but _toad_ does.
